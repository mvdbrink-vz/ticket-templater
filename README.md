Accomplishments
1. Core Features
Dynamic Form Generation:

Based on selected issue type, dynamic fields are created with appropriate labels and input types (text, textarea).
The form automatically adjusts to show only the relevant fields for the selected issue type.
Priority & Issue Type Selector:

Dropdowns allow users to select the issue priority (P1â€“P4) and issue type (e.g., "MultiWifi - Hinder", "Data - Packetloss").
These selections update a live summary bar and feed into the generated template.
Template Output:

A formatted, readable template is generated and displayed, divided into logical sections:
Customer Details
Technical Details
Incident Description
Additional Comments
